<h3>AirBnB Clone </h3>
This is my first project using React JS. previously had some experience with HTML and CSS. <br>
In order to complete this project, I cloned the travel website "AirBnB," which focuses on various travel destinations across the globe.
<br>
This website receives input from a file called data.js, thus it is not static.
It serves as a database, and I have made this code reusable with the use of the map function and props.
By adding and removing data from the data.js file, we can change the content of this website.
